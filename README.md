# Change AI
#### AI calculations. Human Decisions.
Change AI is an AI-powered Return on Investment (ROI) calculator that helps users assess readiness, model risk, and measure the impact of change initiatives. By processing responses from a customized Change Assessment Survey, the app instantly evaluates readiness, models risk, and calculates the projected Return on Investment (ROI). Powered by Azure OpenAI, it turns survey inputs into real-time insights, replacing guesswork and slow feedback loops with data-driven decisions.
